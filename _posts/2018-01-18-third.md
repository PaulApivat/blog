Newcomer’s guide to the Bitcoin white paper

I fell down the rabbit hole late 2017, devouring articles, books, sub-reddits, stack exchange forums and even podcasts ever since. In many ways, crypto is a new world with its own vocabulary, language and culture. There are differences in ideology, perspectives and opinions. There are wars (of words) and alliances. It’s even been compared to the Game of Thrones.

It can be a challenge to sift through all the information. After much wadding around, it occurred to me to go back to the source.

The White Paper

Of course, I’m referring to the white paper written by Satoshi Nakamoto in 2008. The nine pages that launched, as of this writing, a digital currency worth 240 billion USD in market capitalization. The concepts discussed in this paper continue to be relevant today; it’s technology serving as a foundation for years to come. Let me share with you what I’ve learned. Along the way, I’ll bold key words that will help you make sense of the space moving forward.

The way to wrap your mind around bitcoin, heck any new technology, is to ask:

What problem(s) does this solve?
